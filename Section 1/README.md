# Section 1 - Building your first Deep Learning model with Tensorflow 2.0

This section welcomes the students and introduces an overview of the whole contents of the course. This section also gives instructions on how to setup the development environment and focuses on introducing the new features of Tensorflow 2.0. We will create or first deep learning model to understand how we will be using Tensorflow 2.0 to create generative models.
